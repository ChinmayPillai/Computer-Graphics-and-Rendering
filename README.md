# Assignment 2
This assignment focuses on trying to make you sure you have understood the basics of rendering an image as we discussed in the session. The code written is pretty self explanatory and you should be able to understand even if you missed out on a few parts during the session.

Running the project from current branch outputs a image file `image.ppm`. Your task is to madify the `main.cpp` file to generate a new image which looks something like the images given below. 

![hyp.png](/Images/hyp.png "image 1")

![spiral.png](/Images/spiral.png "image 2")

This should be a good excercise in understanding how we have setup the virtual camera in our project to get pixel values for every pixels. You will gain intuition about how pixel number relates to the ray being shot towards it from the origin.

What you have to submit:
-  modified `main.cpp` which generates the first of the given two images
- a new `main1.cpp` which on replacing with main.cpp generates the second of the given two images

Make the required changes and make a pull request to the Assignment_2 branch of the repository.

Make sure the project builds properly using CMake and you get a valid output.

Submission deadline : 7 June, 11:59 PM
